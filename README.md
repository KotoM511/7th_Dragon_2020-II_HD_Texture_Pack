## Description
This project started on 10/1/2020. It was originally a pack for replacing the character potraits only, but I decided to continue expand the pack with GUI elements.
Some potraits are upscaled using waifu2x-caffe. This is created mainly for my personal liking so you might find

## How to install
`Use with Game Settings -> Post Processing Shader: Supersampling AA (Gauss). Tested with PPSSPP ver. 1.10.`

1. Download the repository as .zip then extract contents to \PPSSPP\PSP\TEXTURES\NPJH50716. Create it if there's none!
2. Enable *Replace textures* in *Settings > Options > Developer tools*.
3. All done! You can now play your game with my pack, I recommend you map a button for Texture replacement so you can compare the differences in-game.
