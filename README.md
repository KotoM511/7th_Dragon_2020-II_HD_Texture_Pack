| This is only for NPJH50716 + [Cavespeak](https://cavespeak.org)'s Eng patch v1.00. <br>Can't guarantee it work in original JP version.</br> |

## Description
This project started on 10/1/2020. It was originally a private pack for replacing the character potraits only, but I decided to expand the pack with GUI elements.
Some texture are upscaled using waifu2x-caffe then manually edit, like portraits. This was created mainly for my personal liking so some elements you might not like, such as the font and the icons.

Progress updates with images are available at [twitter log](https://twitter.com/i/events/1251064594044530693) (cannot update anymore due to Twitter changes around the start of 2023, but still update through normal tweets.).
Image comparisons at the bottom.

**Notice:** `Error hash.txt` List of textures unreplacable due to hash clashing or no defined hash.

## How to install
`Use with Game Settings -> Post Processing Shader: Supersampling AA (Gauss). Tested with PPSSPP ver. 1.10.`

1. Download the repository as .zip then extract contents to `\PPSSPP\PSP\TEXTURES\NPJH50716`. This is the address of the game ID, create the folder if there's none.
2. Enable *Replace textures* in *Settings > Options > Developer tools*.
3. All done! You can now play the game with my texture pack. I recommend you map a button for *Texture replacement* so you can compare the differences in-game, best view on desktop.
