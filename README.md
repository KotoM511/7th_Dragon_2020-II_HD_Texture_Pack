| This is only for NPJH50716 + [Cavespeak](https://cavespeak.org)'s eng patch v1.00. <br>Can't guarantee it work in original JP version.</br> |

## Description
This project started on 10/1/2020. It was originally a pack for replacing the character potraits only, but I decided to expand the pack with GUI elements.
Some texture are upscaled using waifu2x-caffe then manually edit, like portraits. This was created mainly for my personal liking so some elements you might not like, such as the font.
<br>Progress updates are available to see at [twitter log](https://twitter.com/i/events/1251064594044530693).</br>

**Notice:** `Error hash.txt` List of textures unreplacable due to hash clashing or no defined hash.

## How to install
`Use with Game Settings -> Post Processing Shader: Supersampling AA (Gauss). Tested with PPSSPP ver. 1.10.`

1. Download the repository as .zip then extract contents to `\PPSSPP\PSP\TEXTURES\NPJH50716`. This is the address of the game ID, create the folder if there's none.
2. Enable *Replace textures* in *Settings > Options > Developer tools*.
3. All done! You can now play the game with my texture pack. I recommend you map a button for Texture replacement so you can compare the differences in-game, best view on desktop.
