Hashrange
0xXXXXXXXX,YYY,ZZZ = AAA, BBB
0x = No reason to change this.
XXXX... = The first 8 digits of dumped texture's filename (The address)
YYY = The Width of the dumped texture (With garbage data)
ZZZ = The Height of the dumped texture (Again, with garbage data)
AAA = The real width of the dumped texture (without the garbage, horizontally the textures tend to repeat rather than generate garbage)
BBB = The height of the texture (without the garbage)

After that the texture will be dumped again with the width specified in A and the height in B, and the correct hash.
